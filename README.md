> Do you remember that endless summer back in '84? Cruising down the ocean-highway with the top down, the wind in our hair and heads buzzing with neon dreams?

> No, I don't remember it either, but with this experimental theme we can go there.

## Installation

* Find your homeassistant directory containing your configuration (let's say `~/.homeassistant/`)
* Update `configuration.yaml` frontend section to look inside a `themes` directory:
```
frontend:
  themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes
```
* Change into `~/.homeassistant/themes` (create the `themes` directory, if it does not exist, you then might have to restart HA)
* `$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbbenji/synthwave-hass/master/themes/synthwave.yaml` downloads the `.yaml` file directly where it should reside
* Change into `~/.homeassistant/www` (create the `www` directory, if it does not exist, you then might have to restart HA)
* `$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbbenji/synthwave-hass/master/synthwave.js` downloads the `.js` file directly where it should reside
* Finally, add the following to the top of your UI Lovelace configuration (means either via Config UI or .yaml)
``` yaml
resources:
  - type: js
    url: /local/synthwave.js
```
* Enable the theme from your profile page or configuration.yaml
